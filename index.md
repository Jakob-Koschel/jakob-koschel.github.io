## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

I have joined the Systems and Network Security Group in February 2020 as a PhD student. My research focuses on system security, operating systems, side-channels and microarchitectural attacks.
I obtained my Master’s degree also at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in Computer Science (Computer Systems & Security) in 2019.

## Research Interest

My research interest focuses on system security. I'm working on microarchitectural side-channels.

## Publications

1. [**NDSS '22**] Koschel, J.; Johannesmeyer, B.; Razavi, K.; Bos, H.; and Giuffrida, C.: [Kasper: Scanning for Generalized Transient Execution Gadgets in the Linux Kernel](https://download.vusec.net/papers/kasper_ndss22.pdf)
2. [**Euro S&P '20**] Koschel, J.; Giuffrida, C.; Bos, H.; and Razavi, K.: [TagBleed: Breaking KASLR on the Isolated Kernel Address Space Using Tagged TLBs](https://download.vusec.net/papers/tagbleed_eurosp20.pdf)

## Presentations

* [**LPC 2022**] Presented how I started chasing speculative type confusion bugs in the kernel and ended up with 'real' ones, *at Linux Plumbers Conference 2022* ([slides](https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1211/attachments/979/1981/LPC2022_slides_Jakob_Koschel.pdf))
* [**Euro S&P 2020**] Presented a new side-channel attack breaking KASLR with Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI) enabled by reverse engineering the TLB layout, *at Euro S&P 2020* ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0lbb7XUfs))

## Open source experience

Submitted patches to various different subsystems of the Linux kernel, responding to feedback and criticism appropriately, resulting in most [patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=jakobkoschel%40gmail.com) (around 80) being accepted by the maintainers of the respective subsystems.

Submitted a [patch](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120490) to llvm-project to enable plugin support for the new pass manager with LTO. Released in LLVM 15 ([commit](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/0c86198b279a98c8550fde318b59ed3ca0ca5045)).
